<h1> Quarantine day in my life </h1>

<font face="MV Boli", size=7 , color=black >
<p> During this Movement Control Order(MCO) everyone start to feeling bored, restless, and sad because they can't meet their family, friends, or loved one due to coronavirus outbreak. Many students are stranded in their university and feeling stress because they can't go back to 
their home because of the MCO. <br> 

<p> This situation is happen to me right now where i stranded in my dorm since March until now i still can't go back to my home. To be honest, I really miss my parents and my siblings and hopefully after this MCO, i can spend more time  with them. <br>

<p> Since the first day of MCO, UiTM provides food for us which is breakfast, lunch and dinner. The warden and the ajk are the one who responsible distribute food to us. Every morning i woke up at 7:30am, and go to the cafe at 8:30am to take my own breakfast. However, for the lunch (12:00pm) and dinner (4:30pm), every students level of the blok has their own task based on the schedules given which we need to send a representative to take the lunch and dinner and distribute it to each person's room.

<p> Usually during afternoon, i clean my dorm room, wash clothes and have a nap or rest for a while. However, during the evening i usually go a walk with my best friend, Cassandra Nickell. We love to have a walk around outside of our dorm to get some fresh air. 
<p> After we go for a walk, we buy our favourite ice-cream at B-Mart and chilling for a while. I usually choose chocolate mix vanilla ice-cream and however, nickell choose chocolate mix yam favor.

<p> Night day is always be my favourite because during the night time, i love having a great time with Nickell where we share our story about our life. She is my good friend since interim until now. I'm so grateful to have her as my best friend because she is the one who always support me, and give encouragement words when i was feeling down. The most important thing that i would like to highlight here is "A good friend knows all your best stories, but a best friend has lived them with you".

<p> For my night routine, Nickell and I usually watching movie together while eating some snacks. This kind of routine is our favourite because the moment we meet up and enjoy eating snacks while watching movie, it makes us happy even though we still feeling sad because we can't spend time with our family during this moment but at least we still have each other here while we stranded in our dorm.

<p> This is how my life is going during the Movement Control Order (MCO), even though we stranded in UiTM right now, but at least we create some precious memories during this time. 
<P> Plus, since this year is our last semester, why not we take this opportunity to create more precious memories while we quarantine ourselves in UiTM.
